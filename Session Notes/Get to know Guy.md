## Session Overview
Guy is a grubby guy. Hes pretty regular by most peoples standards. He is in lust with a lady named Mira. But he definately could use a few lessons in respect. Guy uses the word heroic as a verb, e.g. "I heroic'ed all over you".

Guy was first met by Raven and Calahan outside of the tents. They learned of his love for Mira and offered aid to help him serano her. The promised they would help Guy ~~kidnap~~ woo her by following her over the wall and into the ruined city beyond and helping him throw a beautiful picnic. 

The picnic would inclue cabbage water and blondies, light magical illusions and candlelight. We cleaned and procured Guy a lovely orange scarf from Steve.

We stopped and talked to the Rhinuffalo they are doing quite well. They were a great source of information and miss Krista. 

Once over the wall we investigated the ruins and found a crystal rat monster. While much of the party cowered in fear I charged in and defeated the rat monster and saving DieAnnas life with my healing hands. 

Finally we found a nice clear area for romance. We set the mood, light the candles, gave Guy lots of advice, even lent him a copy of "The Game" he was set. Up came Mira. At first she felt threatened, then creeped out, and by the end she agreed to a date with Guy! Cause like hes a good guy. She told how we could return with guy and help her map more of the RUINs plus she already has a full map of the outer areas!
