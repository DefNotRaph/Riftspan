## Camp
session started at camp. Players found the quest for food posted on the quest board near the bar tent. The group conscripted to protect the wagon wa enjoying a drink and claiming the quest when they were approached by a paladin and a cleric who were attempting to lay claim to the quest. 

Cooky, the cook who loves nicknames, offered the group an opportunity to avoid starvation by helping with the quest. He was however little help in identifying areas to find wildlife. 

The new party members shared that to the south east there was a tiny halfling ghost vilage and that their traveling partner Sorrel had 'accidentally' knocked it down. 

Draylor met a member of the community and new friend Glunk. Glunk informed the party that there were massive creatures (Rhinuffalo) to the north west in the rolling hills. 

The party stopped at the quartermaster Sarnas and recieved supplies. Health kit, nets, pitons, rope, rations. The quartermaster also provided a scouting report from Gerald as to the further location of Rhinuffalo

## Rolling Highlands
The group travels north west to find the rolling hills. Not much is known of the hills. The group encountered a heard of rhinuffallo who were chased by axebeak predators. The group managed to fight and kill the axebeak predators and subdue the heard. The rhinuffalo were injured but we were able to save them. Krista is getting WAY to attached but I am hopeful that we can domesticate the heard and have a traveling heard that moves with the camp.
